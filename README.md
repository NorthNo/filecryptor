<h2>Python File Encryptor-Decryptor</h2>
The main purpose of the program is to encrypt the files that you want to keep secret by giving them a key value and to ensure confidentiality by decrypting them with this key value whenever you want. You can examine the function of the code through the comment lines in the code sequence, through the file I explained.

<h2>Installing</h2>

``` git clone https://github.com/NorthNo/filecryptor ``` <br>
``` cd filecryptor ``` <br>
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` <br>

<h2>Using FileCryptor</h2>

The program might get 3 argument, its target file path, -d decode or -e encode and your private key you can use random key but dont forget it you need again for decode.<br>
``` python whatainnocentprogram.py target_file_path (-d or -e) key(int) ```
